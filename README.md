# Access Dental Appointment System
The Access Dental Appointment System aims to simplify the tracking of the appointments scheduled in the clinic by providing a simple yet powerful user interface for quick navigation. The software will provide a simple field for adding, editing, and deleting appointments, as well as quick data view changes to view and perform tasks on appointments in other days as well. The software will also provide easy access to the appointment schedules of different doctors, viewing their own as well as others’ schedules. The software will also employ an admin page that aims to control the dentists and the procedures and the accounts that access the system as well as other necessary details about the residency of the dentists.

The specific objectives of the software are as follows:

-To provide a facility for managing the record of all scheduled appointments.

-To provide a facility for tracking specific dentists’ scheduled appointments.

-To provide a facility for easily adding, deleting, and updating appointment schedules.

-To provide a facility that can easily adapt to the changing dentist residency schedules and leaves.

-To provide a facility for quick navigation across dates of scheduled appointments.

-To provide a facility for managing all dentists and processes details involved in an appointment.
